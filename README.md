### About me
I'm Simon, a software engineer who's into open-source development and teaching.
My most cherished project is [RepoBee](https://repobee.org), a tool to manage
Git repositories for education. Occasionally, I write a post on [my
blog](https://slar.se).

| [Eleven Table Tennis: A VR masterpiece](https://slar.se/eleven-table-tennis-a-vr-masterpiece.html)                                | As a software engineer, I sit and stand still for large chunks of the day. Unfortunately, I'm also a big fan of playing video games, which traditionally falls into the same category of physical exercise. Much to avoid repetitive stress injury and everything else that comes along with sitting at …        |
| [Learning a new programming language as a practicing software engineer](https://slar.se/learning-a-new-programming-language.html) | When it comes to programming languages, I consider myself something of a polyglot. To me, learning a new language is one of the most enjoyable things in all of software engineering. This is especially true when you start to venture into new paradigms; going from procedural to functional, functional to … |

This year, ITiCSE went virtual, but RepoBee still made an appearance in the new tools and tricks section with a small, two-page paper. Although I let my co-author Ric Glassey deal with the virtual presentation, I'm still quite proud …    |
