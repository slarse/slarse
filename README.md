### About me
I'm Simon, a software engineer who's into open-source development and teaching.
My most cherished project is [RepoBee](https://repobee.org), a tool to manage
Git repositories for education. Occasionally, I write a post on [my
blog](https://slar.se).

| [First impressions of Wayland on Arch Linux](https://slar.se/wayland-one-month-later.html)                            | Wayland appears to be the future of window systems in the world of Linux, replacing the aging X.Org window system. The Arch Wiki article on X.Org refers to it as "the alternative and successor [of X.Org]" and Canonical even dropped its own Mir display server in favor …               |
| [Dependabot's dependency grouping is awesome](https://slar.se/dependabots-dependency-grouping.html)                   | I've been using GitHub's Dependabot since it was released around 4 years ago, and to a large extent, it's been great. Except for one thing: the sheer amount of pull requests Dependabot would open for dependency updates. For some of my repositories it became more of a chore to keep … |

Like GIT(1), SUDO(8) or open(n). What's that thing in parentheses? To cut a long story short, it's the section …                                          |
| [The sheer insanity of interfaces and nil in Go](https://slar.se/the-sheer-insanity-of-interfaces-and-nil-in-go.html) | If you've only dabbled briefly in Go, you might think that its nil is analogous to the good ol' "billion dollar mistake" known as null. I thought so, too, up until just a few weeks ago when I decided to make a pass through Thorsten Ball's neat little book Writing …                   |
