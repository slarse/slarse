### About me
I'm Simon, a software engineer who's into open-source development and teaching.
My most cherished project is [RepoBee](https://repobee.org), a tool to manage
Git repositories for education. Occasionally, I write a post on [my
blog](https://slar.se).

I finally took the time to make a dark theme! Only 5 or so years late to the party. But late or not, I have a new theme to show off, so let's have a look …                                                                    |

Like GIT(1), SUDO(8) or open(n). What's that thing in parentheses? To cut a long story short, it's the section …                                                            |
| [The sheer insanity of interfaces and nil in Go](https://slar.se/the-sheer-insanity-of-interfaces-and-nil-in-go.html) | If you've only dabbled briefly in Go, you might think that its nil is analogous to the good ol' "billion dollar mistake" known as null. I thought so, too, up until just a few weeks ago when I decided to make a pass through Thorsten Ball's neat little book Writing …                                     |
| [Book Review: Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://slar.se/book-review-writing-an-interpreter-in-go.html)            | I love programming languages, both using them and implementing them. As such, I found the concept of learning Go by creating a programming language to be just delightful. And, to put it briefly, it was. Let's talk about Thorsten Ball's book on interpreters. In Go.

| [Fix 3D graphics in Arch Linux on Dell XPS 15 9520](https://slar.se/xps-15-9520-arch-linux-intel-dri2.html)           | I recently got myself a Dell XPS 15 9520 to replace my aging laptop. It's highly Linux-compatible and just following the official installation guide got me 90% of the way of having a well-behaved Arch Linux laptop. One big thing wasn't working, though: 3D graphics!
