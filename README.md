| [Book Review: Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://slar.se/book-review-writing-an-interpreter-in-go.html)  | I love programming languages, both using them and implementing them. As such, I found the concept of learning Go by creating a programming language to be just delightful. And, to put it briefly, it was. Let's talk about Thorsten Ball's book on interpreters. In Go. Writing an Interpreter in Go …                                        |
| [Fix 3D graphics in Arch Linux on Dell XPS 15 9520](https://slar.se/xps-15-9520-arch-linux-intel-dri2.html) | I recently got myself a Dell XPS 15 9520 to replace my aging laptop. It's highly Linux-compatible and just following the official installation guide got me 90% of the way of having a well-behaved Arch Linux laptop. One big thing wasn't working, though: 3D graphics! Symptoms: glitchy 2D graphics and …                                  |
| [Book Review: CPython Internals](https://slar.se/book-review-cpython-internals.html)                        | About a month ago I signed myself up to do a talk at a Python meetup hosted by HiQ. I brazenly set my topic as Under the Hood of CPython, thinking I had sufficient understanding of its inner workings to produce a riveting talk. As I started preparing the talk …                                                                          |
| [The difference between Python and CPython](https://slar.se/the-difference-between-python-and-cpython.html) | At one point or another, every Python developer or hobbyist encounters the word CPython. For example, the dis module states that it exposes an "implementation detail of the CPython interpreter". What does that mean? Some ask themselves how CPython differs from Python, and then they move on with their lives …                          |
| [The pre Python 2.5 ternary operator hack](https://slar.se/python-24-ternary.html)                          | The modern day ternary operator is well-known to most Pythonistas: &lt;expr_if_true&gt; if &lt;condition&gt; else &lt;expr_if_false&gt;   It's officially known as a conditional expression and was introduced back in Python 2.5 with PEP 308. Some like it, some don't, and while discussing it with a colleague of mine he mentioned that … |
