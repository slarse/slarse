### About me
I'm Simon, a software engineer who's into open source development and teaching.
My most cherished project is [RepoBee](https://repobee.org), a tool to manage
Git repositories for education. Occasionally, I write a post on [my
blog](https://slar.se).

| [Taking a step back from open source development](https://slar.se/taking-a-step-back-from-open-source-development.html)        | Over the past couple of years, I've half-heartedly tried to keep up with the bar I set for open source contributions back when I was in university. It has not been easy, and ultimately I haven't been able to align my current projects with where I'm taking my career. I's …                                         |
| [Book Review: Cybersecurity Myths and Misconceptions](https://slar.se/book-review-cybersecurity-myths-and-misconceptions.html) | The world of cybersecurity is full of perils. Many of those perils stem from misconceptions about the nature of cybersecurity. If you come to the insight that perfect security is unachievable, you may reach the conclusion that being concerned with cybersecurity at all is a waste of your time. After …            |

He told me that 90% of his work was to just add and reorganize indexes to speed up queries. That was almost 10 years ago, and I'm now …                                                       |

Input devices was a display server concern under X.Org, so the window manager had nothing to do with it. Notably, now click-on-tap is not working for me …                                     |
| [Syntax highlight anything with Tree-sitter](https://slar.se/syntax-highlight-anything-with-tree-sitter.html)                  | As of my previous post on extending NeoVim for commenting and uncommenting code blocks, I'm on something of a NeoVim extension streak. The flavor of the week is syntax highlighting. I've been using the highly customizable nvim-treesitter for the past few years. This depends on there being a Tree-sitter parser … |
