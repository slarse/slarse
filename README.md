### About me
I'm Simon, a software engineer who's into open source development and teaching.
My most cherished project is [RepoBee](https://repobee.org), a tool to manage
Git repositories for education. Occasionally, I write a post on [my
blog](https://slar.se).

As I don't have much experience with image formats, it took me a while to figure out what the actual request was: to print the QR …                                              |

You can focus on just about one thing at a time. This doesn't mean that you can only do one thing at a time, because not all things you do require your full attention.

It has not been easy, and ultimately I haven't been able to align my current projects with where I'm taking my career. I's …                              |
