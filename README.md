### About me
I'm Simon, a software engineer who's into open-source development and teaching.
My most cherished project is [RepoBee](https://repobee.org), a tool to manage
Git repositories for education. Occasionally, I write a post on [my
blog](https://slar.se).

| [Eleven Table Tennis: A VR masterpiece](https://slar.se/eleven-table-tennis-a-vr-masterpiece.html)       | As a software engineer, I sit and stand still for large chunks of the day.
