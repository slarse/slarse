### About me
I'm Simon, a software engineer who's into open-source development and teaching.
My most cherished project is [RepoBee](https://repobee.org), a tool to manage
Git repositories for education. Occasionally, I write a post on [my
blog](https://slar.se).

implement a few of the basic data structures that I've picked up during my
three years of computer science studies. First up, we have a generic binary

experience. One of the first things I wanted to do was to create a standalone
<code>.jar</code> file, including the Kotlin runtime and any other dependencies. This,
as it turns out, was a bit tricky. In this …</p>                                                                                                                    | 2018-10-29T21:02:18+00:00 |

With classes come <code>self</code>, the <em>seemingly</em> (do note the emphasis there)
magical keyword that you just have to write out as the first parameter to every
