### About me
I'm Simon, a software engineer who's into open-source development and teaching.
My most cherished project is [RepoBee](https://repobee.org), a tool to manage
Git repositories for education. Occasionally, I write a post on [my
blog](https://slar.se).

| [Extending NeoVim for commenting and uncommenting code blocks](https://slar.se/comment-and-uncomment-code-in-neovim.html) | I've been using some variation of Vim for going on a decade now, yet I've never bothered with an efficient way of commenting out code. It just isn't something that I do very often. But I saw a colleague comment out and uncomment lines of code like a breeze in …                                                          |

The Arch Wiki article on X.Org refers to it as "the alternative and successor [of X.Org]" and Canonical even dropped its own Mir display server in favor …                                                  |
| [Dependabot's dependency grouping is awesome](https://slar.se/dependabots-dependency-grouping.html)                       | I've been using GitHub's Dependabot since it was released around 4 years ago, and to a large extent, it's been great. Except for one thing: the sheer amount of pull requests Dependabot would open for dependency updates. For some of my repositories it became more of a chore to keep …                                    |
