It's highly Linux-compatible and just following the official installation guide got me 90% of the way of having a well-behaved Arch Linux laptop. One big thing wasn't working, though: 3D graphics!

For example, the dis module states that it exposes an "implementation detail of the CPython interpreter". What does that mean?
