### About me
I'm Simon, a software engineer who's into open-source development and teaching.
My most cherished project is [RepoBee](https://repobee.org), a tool to manage
Git repositories for education. Occasionally, I write a post on [my
blog](https://slar.se).

This year, ITiCSE went virtual, but RepoBee still made an appearance in the new tools and tricks section with a small, two-page paper.
